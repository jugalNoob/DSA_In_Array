Here are the top algorithms used in rate limiting, along with when and why you'd use each:

🚀 1. Token Bucket
✅ Best for: Allowing burst traffic while enforcing a steady average rate.

Allows bursts (if tokens are available).

Simple to implement.

Used in: APIs, CDNs, cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).

Example Use:

A user can send 5 requests in a burst, then 1 request per second after that.

🚿 2. Leaky Bucket
✅ Best for: Enforcing a smooth, constant rate, like a traffic shaper.

Processes requests at a fixed rate.

Good for evenly spaced outbound traffic.

Often used in routers/switches.

Example Use:

Send exactly 1 request per second, no bursts.

⏱️ 3. Fixed Window Counter
✅ Best for: Simplicity.

Divide time into fixed windows (e.g., 1 minute).

Count requests in that window.

If limit is exceeded → block.

Downside:

Allows bursts at window edges (e.g., 100 requests at 0:59 and 1:00 = 200 total).

Example Use:

Max 100 requests per minute.

⌛ 4. Sliding Window Log
✅ Best for: High accuracy.

Store timestamps of every request.

Check how many occurred in the past X seconds.

Accurate but memory-heavy.

Example Use:

Strict rate enforcement with precise tracking per user.

📏 5. Sliding Window Counter
✅ Best for: A balance between Fixed Window and Log.

Divides time into small windows (e.g., 1 sec) and tracks counts.

Uses interpolation for smoothing.

Efficient + more accurate than Fixed Window.

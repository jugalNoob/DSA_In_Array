In data structures, queues come in several types, depending on how elements are added, accessed, and removed. Below is a list of common types of queue data structures, each with a short explanation and use case:

🧱 1. Simple Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)
Behavior: Enqueue at the rear, dequeue from the front.

Use Case: Printer tasks, task scheduling.

Edit
Front  → [1, 2, 3, 4] ← Rear
Dequeue → 1
🔄 2. Circular Queue
Behavior: Reuses empty space by wrapping around the end of the array.

Use Case: Memory-efficient queues like in embedded systems, buffering data streams.

Rear wraps to the front when end is reached.
🪜 3. Priority Queue
Behavior: Elements are dequeued based on priority, not insertion order.

Use Case: Job scheduling, Dijkstra's algorithm, A* pathfinding.

Edit
[ {value: "A", priority: 2}, {value: "B", priority: 1} ]
→ Dequeues "B" before "A"
🧬 4. Double-Ended Queue (Deque)
Behavior: Insertion and removal from both ends.

Use Case: Palindrome checkers, sliding window problems.

Types:

Input-restricted deque: insert at rear only

Output-restricted deque: delete from front only

🧊 5. Monotonic Queue
Behavior: Maintains increasing or decreasing order.

Use Case: Efficiently finding min/max in a sliding window.

🔀 6. Concurrent Queue / Thread-safe Queue
Behavior: Used in multithreading or parallel programming.

Use Case: Producer-consumer problems, event-driven systems.

Examples:

Java: ConcurrentLinkedQueue

Node.js: BullMQ queues with Redis

Python: queue.Queue with threading

🔁 7. Delay Queue / Timed Queue
Behavior: Items are dequeued only after a delay or timestamp.

Use Case: Retry mechanisms, scheduling delayed jobs (e.g. BullMQ, RabbitMQ).

🧰 8. Multiple Queues
Behavior: Two or more queues managed in a system for different classes/types.

Use Case: Operating system process scheduling (e.g., foreground vs background).

🧪 9. Real-Time Queues (Functional Queues)
Behavior: Used in functional programming (e.g., Haskell, Clojure), optimized for immutability.

Use Case: Persistent data structures where immutability is crucial.

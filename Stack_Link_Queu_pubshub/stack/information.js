Here’s a complete breakdown of the types of stack data structures, with explanations, examples, and use cases:

🔁 1. Simple Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out)
Behavior: Push to top, pop from top.

Use Case: Undo/redo, function call stack, expression evaluation.

Edit
Top → [A, B, C] ← Bottom
Pop() → removes C
🔄 2. Array-Based Stack
Implementation: Stack built using arrays (fixed size).

Pros: Fast, simple.

Cons: Limited by array size.

c

Edit
int stack[100];
🧱 3. Linked List-Based Stack
Implementation: Stack using linked nodes (dynamic size).

Pros: Grows as needed.

Cons: Slight overhead.

c
Copy
Edit
struct Node { int data; Node* next; }
🧮 4. Two Stacks in One Array
Behavior: Two stacks grow from opposite ends of the array.

Use Case: Space-efficient memory management.

🔀 5. Stack of Stacks (Set of Stacks)
Behavior: Collection of stacks behaving as one.

Use Case: When individual stacks reach size limits.

Example: Like plates stacked in sets — when one set is full, start a new one.

🔢 6. Min Stack / Max Stack
Behavior: Supports retrieval of current min/max in O(1) time.

Use Case: Stock span problems, min/max in a sliding window.

push(x), pop(), getMin() in O(1)
🪜 7. Expression Stack
Behavior: Used in parsing and evaluating expressions.

Use Case:

Infix → Postfix/Prefix conversion

Postfix evaluation

Balancing parentheses

🔄 8. Multithreaded / Concurrent Stack
Behavior: Thread-safe stack implementation.

Use Case: Parallel algorithms, system-level design.

Examples:

Java: ConcurrentLinkedDeque

C++: lock-free stack with atomics

🧠 9. Recursive Stack (Call Stack)
Behavior: Managed by the system to handle function calls and returns.

Use Case: Recursion, stack overflow errors.

Edit
Function A → calls B → calls C → returns → B → A
🧮 10. Double Stack (for special algorithms)
Behavior: Two stacks used to simulate a queue, or for two-pass algorithms.

Use Case: Implementing a queue using two stacks, or undo-redo systems.

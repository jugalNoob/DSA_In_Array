Non-Decreasing Array with One Change

What: Check if array can be made non-decreasing by modifying ≤1 element.

Trick: Greedy validation with edge cases.

First Missing Positive (Hard)

What: Find the smallest missing positive integer in unsorted array.

Trick: Use array indices as hash keys (marking).

Maximum Product Subarray

What: Subarray with largest product (handling negatives).

Trick: Track max_so_far and min_so_far simultaneously.

Rain Water Trapping

What: Calculate trapped water between bars.

Trick: Two-pointer or prefix/suffix max arrays.

⚡ OPTIMIZATION TRICKS
How to impress interviewers:

Space Optimization

Reuse input array as output (e.g., arr[i] % n to store 2 values).

Example: "Rearrange array such that arr[arr[i]] becomes i."

Bitmasking with Arrays

Use Case: Subset generation, XOR tricks (e.g., "Find two unique numbers in array").

Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

What: Find majority element in O(1) space.

Trick: Cancel out pairs of unequal elements.

Quickselect (k-th Smallest/Largest)

What: O(n) avg time (like quicksort but partial).

Trick: Pivot selection strategy matters.

Reservoir Sampling

What: Randomly select k items from a stream (unknown size).

Use Case: Random sampling in big data.

💡 PRO TIPS FOR INTERVIEWS
Clarify Constraints Early

Ask: "Can the array contain negatives/duplicates?"

Example: If array is sorted, binary search might apply.

Mention Time-Space Tradeoffs

"We can solve this in O(n) space with a hashmap, or O(n log n) time with sorting."

Practice Edge Cases

Empty array, single element, all identical elements, large inputs.

Draw It Out

Use whiteboard to visualize pointers/windows (e.g., sliding window).

Name the Pattern

"This is a variation of Kadane’s algorithm with a twist."

📚 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Master 3 Key Problems:

Sliding Window Maximum (Deque).

Longest Subarray with Sum K (Hashmap).

Merge Intervals (Sorting + Greedy).

Books: "Elements of Programming Interviews" (arrays section).

Platforms: LeetCode (Top Interview Questions), Codeforces (Div2 C/D).

This toolkit covers 90% of array problems in interviews. Prioritize Sliding Window, Two-Pointer, and Prefix Sum—they appear most frequently! 🚀
